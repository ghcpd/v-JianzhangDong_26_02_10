# Dependency Upgrade Challenge

## Problem

The project won't run - Python version is set to 3.14 (doesn't exist), pytest versions don't match, and all dependencies are 2-4 years old.

## What to Do

Upgrade everything to latest versions and make the tests pass:

- Fix Python version in `pyproject.toml` 
- Update all dependencies in `requirements.txt`
- Handle any breaking changes (especially Pydantic v1→v2)
- Create missing `.env` file if needed

## Success Criteria

Run `pytest` and save results to `logs/` folder. All tests must pass.

**Rules:** Don't modify test files. Fix the code, not the tests.
All modifications should be made only in the issue_project_fixed folder, keeping the original issue_project folder unchanged
